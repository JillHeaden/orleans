# Tutorials and Samples

## What do I need?

The tutorials and samples are self-contained, except where noted.

The tutorials are intended to give step-by-step instructions for achieving a task, with links to places you can find more information.
The sample app overviews do not necessarily contain steps.
They are intended to me more like study guides.

Note: You might need an Azure subscription for some of these.
For the Azure-based samples, you will need to install the SDK.

The samples can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/Samples).

## [Tutorial One - Orleans Test](tutorial_1_orleanstest.md)

The steps of this tutorial include creating the structure and adding the NuGet packages to basic Orleans application.

## [Sample App - Hello World](overview_helloworld.md)

This is a thorough overview of the Hello World sample application.
It is similar to the application resulting from following the steps of Tutorial One.
